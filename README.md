# Shell Registry Setter

Features:
* Toggling hidden/system files visibility with a single click of context menu
* Copies path of Explorer file/folder to clipboard while also correctly quoting it if it contains spaces
* Removes shortcut overlay on icons
* Creates correct shortcuts in a form `filename.lnk`. It correctly drops filename extension and does not add any useless `- Shortcut` in the end
* Creates [symbolic links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/symbolic-links) if you Shift-press the Explorer item
* Creates [hard links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/hard-links-and-junctions) if you Shift-press the Explorer item

_Note: you might want to change localisation of some strings to your native OS language, currently most of them are in Ukrainian.
